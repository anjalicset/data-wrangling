# data-wrangling
data_wrangling_and_cleaning.ipynb is a colab notebook to perform basic data sanitization steps before proceeding with feature engineering and modelling. data cleaning and profiling steps are performed on data sets of a clinical trail for diabetes. 
This is a dataset of about 500 patients of which 350 patients participated in a clinical trial. None of the patients were using Novodra (a popular injectable insulin) or Auralin (the oral insulin being researched) as their primary source of insulin before. All were experiencing elevated HbA1c levels.

All 350 patients were treated with Novodra to establish a baseline HbA1c level and insulin dose. After 4 weeks, which isnâ€™t enough time to capture all the change in HbA1c that can be attributed by the switch to Auralin or Novodra:

175 patients switched to Auralin for 24 weeks 175 patients continued using Novodra for 24 weeks Data about patients feeling some adverse effects is also recorded.
